# Pulsara IVR v2 Integration Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Analyzed current IVR system architecture
2. ✅ Identified key modularization points
3. ✅ Created comprehensive API schema documentation for dashboard integration
4. ✅ Documented the "why" behind each API component
5. ✅ Created API schema summary showing relationships between components
6. ✅ Restructured the application to follow enterprise-grade architecture
7. ✅ Created modular components for restaurant, agent, call, and knowledge base management
8. ✅ Implemented service layer for external integrations (Twilio, ElevenLabs, Email)
9. ✅ Created API routes for call handling, webhooks, and health checks
10. ✅ Added tests for core functionality

## Next Steps for IVR System

1. [ ] Modify config.py to remove hardcoded restaurant values
   - [ ] Replace hardcoded restaurant name with API lookup
   - [ ] Replace hardcoded address with API lookup
   - [ ] Replace hardcoded phone numbers with API lookup
   - [ ] Add restaurant ID parameter for API calls

2. [ ] Implement restaurant identification
   - [ ] Add logic to identify restaurant from incoming call
   - [ ] Add API call to fetch restaurant configuration
   - [ ] Implement call hours validation

3. [ ] Update agent configuration
   - [ ] Modify agent creation to use restaurant-specific ElevenLabs agent ID
   - [ ] Update system prompt to use restaurant-specific variables
   - [ ] Configure tools based on restaurant settings

4. [ ] Implement knowledge base integration
   - [ ] Add API calls to fetch restaurant knowledge base
   - [ ] Integrate knowledge base with agent context
   - [ ] Implement knowledge base caching for performance

5. [ ] Enhance call handling
   - [ ] Add call logging to dashboard API
   - [ ] Implement sentiment analysis for calls
   - [ ] Add call summary generation
   - [ ] Implement call completion notification

6. [ ] Add webhook support
   - [ ] Register webhooks for restaurant updates
   - [ ] Implement webhook handlers for configuration changes
   - [ ] Add webhook security validation

7. [ ] Implement authentication
   - [ ] Add API key management
   - [ ] Implement secure token storage
   - [ ] Add request signing for API calls

8. [ ] Testing and deployment
   - [ ] Create test suite for API integration
   - [ ] Test with multiple restaurant configurations
   - [ ] Implement graceful fallback for API failures
   - [ ] Deploy to staging environment

## Current Focus

The current focus is on two key areas:

1. Replacing the ElevenLabs SDK with direct API calls for better stability and control:
   - ✅ Created a direct API client (elevenlabs_api_client.py)
   - ✅ Implemented WebSocket conversation handling (elevenlabs_conversation.py)
   - ✅ Updated the elevenlabs.py service to use the direct API client
   - ✅ Modified call_routes.py to use our new implementation
   - ✅ Updated requirements.txt to remove SDK dependency

2. Modifying the IVR system to remove hardcoded restaurant values and implement restaurant identification based on incoming calls:
   - [ ] Refactoring config.py to use API calls instead of hardcoded values
   - [ ] Adding logic to identify which restaurant is being called
   - [ ] Implementing API calls to fetch restaurant-specific configuration
   - [ ] Updating the agent creation process to use restaurant-specific ElevenLabs agent IDs

## Key Files to Modify

- **config.py**: Remove hardcoded restaurant values
- **main.py**: Add restaurant identification logic
- **app.py**: Update webhook handlers to include restaurant context
- **systemprompt.py**: Modify to use restaurant-specific variables
- **twilio_audio_interface.py**: Update to include restaurant context in calls
- **server_tools.py**: Add API integration for agent tools

## Issues and Challenges

- Need to ensure backward compatibility during transition
- Need to handle API failures gracefully
- Need to implement caching for performance
- Need to ensure secure API authentication
- Need to handle multiple concurrent calls to different restaurants
- Need to test with various restaurant configurations
- Need to thoroughly test the direct API implementation with real calls
- Need to implement proper error handling for WebSocket communication
